Followed the instructions on [a fairly old post (2014) by Barry Clark](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), I finally managed to build/fork a Jekyll engined blog and have it hosted on GitHub. However, I wanted to host it under  
`https://<GITHUBUSERNAME>.github.io/blog`  
rather than  
`https://<GITHUBUSERNAME>.github.io`.

On his post, he states that this would _introduces some complexity_. True, but fairly easy to resolve as well:  
 Step 1. Edit the `_config.yml` file  
 Step 2. Configuring a publishing source

### Step 1. Edit the `_config.yml` file

Assuming you have forked Clark's [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repository, all you have to do is to find _\_config.yml_ file, open it, find `Baseurl:`, add `"/repository-name"`, it should be looking like this:

`Baseurl: "/blog"` (if _blog_ is your repository name)

#### Do NOT forget the `/` before the repository-name.

### Step 2. Configuring a publishing source (If you haven't done so)

1. Find the `Settings` option on your GitHub repository.
2. Find "GitHub Pages", select 'gh-pages branch' under Source drop-down menu

After a few seconds, refresh the page you should be able to see the green banner under "GitHub Pages" says your site is published at `https://<GITHUBUSERNAME>.github.io/<YOURPROJECTNAME>` this link.
  
Click the link and VOILÀ! Simple eh?!

#### No `gh-pages` branch needed

Accidentally, I created `gh-pages` branch at first published from this branch (_Settings > GitHub Pages > Source_) and switched back to `master branch`, found out that the site still loads perfectly.

### Beware in which branch of the repository you are modifying

As a beginner, be very careful of the branch in which modification takes place. If necessary set the branch to default branch under _Settings > Branches > Default branch_.
