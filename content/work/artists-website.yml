  - My Chinese name is Li, Peiwen. Before 2020, I called myself Don Lee to fit 'in' when I wasn't really sure 'in what' and 'why in'. You can argue that a name is nothing more than a label which I agree. And I also agree - 'less is more'. So why don't I keep the consistency, use ONE name, and stop confusing people or myself eh?!
  - Regardless of the name, this simple yet elegant website featuring my experimental photography series is where it all begins. I first built it in 2015 during the Chrismas holidays in a flat no more than 12 square metres along a London high street...
  - ...My metatarsal is broken so staying in the flat which sits right in front of Finsbury Park Station along Victoria line is my only option. Luckily, I enjoy being along. Plus, the website has to be built before the degree show. So I learn the basics of HTML and CSS, build the site within a week. I find myself enjoying the serenity of the coding process, which, a couple years later, prompts me the idea of doing it as a career.
  - After all these years, I am still proud of this very first website. Maybe I could modernise it and integrate it with Peiwen.me.
