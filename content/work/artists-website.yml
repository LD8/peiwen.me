  - A simple yet elegant website for Don Lee's experimental photography series. This a relatively early work of mine (around 2015) before I started to learn python.
  - It is the challenges I overcame during the making of this particular project which gave me the drive to study programming. I found that coding was fun and I enjoyed the serenity of the practice.
