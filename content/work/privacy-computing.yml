  - Points.org was a startup I briefly worked with in 2021. The CEO strives to create a network through which businesses are able to share their data safely so that machine learning could result in higher accuracy amongst many other things this network might achieve.
  - A data management platform was ready to come out. I was offered the opportunity to help with the UX design as well as to single-handedly scaffold the front-end system.
  - The tech used in my previous project (Quantitative Trading System) was enough to meet the requirement. However, There were two main challenges.
  - Firstly, to create a complex authentication system with many roles. It took me a couple of weeks to resolve.
  - Secondly, to do competitive research. Because this was a new thing with few competitors on the market, I had to treat our project manager and CEO as the primary source of the research. I had to dig deeper, to fully understand the logic behind in order to create a user story, a relatively good user experience.
