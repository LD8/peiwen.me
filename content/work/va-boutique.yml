  - VA-boutique.com was built within a month. The client was hoping to launch the website within 3 weeks. It was certainly a challenge. The tight schedule pushed me to develop a methodology to solve the problems efficiently along the way.
  - Although the website is no longer maintained by me, I acquired a great deal of knowledge on the back-end side for building this e-commerce website.
