  - VA-boutique.com is built with Django for back-end as well as front-end (with mainly Django template). It was a challenge because of the time frame. The stakeholder hoped that they could launch the website within a couple of weeks. The tight schedule pushed me to develop an efficient methodology to solve the problems along the way. I acquired a great deal of knowledge in terms of the back-end in web design.
