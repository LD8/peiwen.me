  - Now, the project should be called 'peiwen.me' for better identification since the direction in which I will go became clearer than ever. The aesthetic changes over the years. The tech evolves. This website (peiwen.me) employs MongoDB to store journals. I also built a hidden log in mechanism and a journal creater/editor just for my personal use.
  - First release (2020) of the website combined Django Framework as the backend serving API calls, React handles the frontend and most of the routing. Because my study notes, blogs will be hosted and presented here as well, I implemented Postgres for ease of management, future expansion and stability. It is hosted on AWS Lightsail VPS, certainly a fun thing to fiddle around. The loading speed of the site yet needs to be optimised and I am aware that there is much more to learn but this, for me, is a great starting point.
  - Second release (2021) of this website employed NextJS so that the whole website is generated statically. Django RESTful API is great, however, I wanted to explore the full potential of frontend SPA as well as my newly learned skills.
